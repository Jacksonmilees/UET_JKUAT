=== FRONTEND ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED ===

PROBLEM:
Your frontend .env files were pointing to the WRONG backend URL:
- Was using: https://uet-jkuat.onrender.com/api (OLD/WRONG)
- Should use: https://uetjkuat-54286e10a43b.herokuapp.com/api (CORRECT)

WHAT I FIXED:
✓ Updated .env file with correct API URL
✓ Updated .env.local file with correct API URL  
✓ Separated Gemini AI key from backend API key
✓ All admin modules are correctly configured

BACKEND STATUS:
✓ All endpoints tested and working
✓ Dashboard stats: Working
✓ Transactions: Working (1 real transaction)
✓ Accounts: Working (1 account)
✓ Reports: Working
✓ Everything ready!

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Open your project settings
3. Go to Environment Variables
4. Add: VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://uetjkuat-54286e10a43b.herokuapp.com/api
5. Redeploy your frontend

AFTER REDEPLOYMENT:
✓ Admin dashboard will load correctly
✓ All tabs will work (Overview, Users, Projects, Accounts, Transactions, etc.)
✓ Stats will show real data
✓ Transactions will display
✓ Everything will work perfectly!

THE ROUTING WAS NEVER BROKEN:
- Admin tabs work fine (Overview, Users, Projects, etc.)
- The issue was just wrong API URL in environment variables
- Once Vercel has correct env vars, everything will work!

FILES UPDATED:
- uetjkuat-funding-platform/.env
- uetjkuat-funding-platform/.env.local
- Created: VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.txt (instructions)

NEXT STEP:
Update Vercel environment variables and redeploy!
