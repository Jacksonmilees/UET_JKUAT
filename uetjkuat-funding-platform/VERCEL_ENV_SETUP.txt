=== VERCEL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ===

GO TO: https://vercel.com/your-project/settings/environment-variables

ADD THESE VARIABLES:

1. VITE_API_BASE_URL
   Value: https://uetjkuat-54286e10a43b.herokuapp.com/api
   
2. VITE_API_KEY
   Value: (leave empty for now - backend endpoints are public)

3. GEMINI_API_KEY
   Value: AIzaSyD_YPOtfYq_YQpRmPF47KF_wdyhNjzYIhw

=== AFTER ADDING VARIABLES ===

1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
3. Check "Use existing Build Cache" = NO
4. Click "Redeploy"

=== THIS WILL FIX ===

✓ Admin dashboard will load data correctly
✓ Transactions will display
✓ All API calls will go to correct backend
✓ Stats will show real data
✓ Everything will work!

=== CURRENT ISSUE ===

Your frontend was calling the wrong API URL (render.com instead of heroku.com)
Now it's fixed to call: https://uetjkuat-54286e10a43b.herokuapp.com/api

All admin modules will work after redeployment!
